### Dismissal

[CO-HOST]: You may now head to your designated role. If you need help, please let me, our host, the helper or any other supervisor\!

# The Shift

Once you've dismissed them all, ensure the meeting room is closed. No-one should be in there.

Make sure you are on the lookout for people to promote.

Ensure you have <Icon icon="vest" iconType="regular" /> **Hyra** up and running; you can look at Burger King orders to see performance.

It's a good practise to have Discord open.

The Shift should last for at least 45 minutes. If you have to go, you can end early (make sure a director can sort it out).

<Tip>
  Did you know that shifts can last for as long as you want\! (45 minute minimum)
</Tip>

### Breaks

Have your helper be at the  <Icon icon="bed" /> **Break Room** and announce breaks.

Use the timer on the board to set a timer for **<u>5 minutes</u>** per break.

# End of Shift

## De-briefing

Run the following command in the console:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Command">
    `h All staff members to the meeting room please for the shift de-briefing.`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Once everyone is back, make sure they are all included in the shift.

### Promotions

[HOST]: Welcome back, how was your shift?

<Note>
  Let them talk. Any questions can be answered by the shift staff.
</Note>

You can handle it from here. Your supervisor can rank.
